# Real Estate Price Prediction in Sri Lanka


The project uses the Sri Lanka House Prices Dataset from Kaggle.com to train regression models. The best model is then deployed to a Flask server, which can be accessed by users to get real estate price predictions.

This project is a great way to learn about the data science process and how to build a machine learning model. It is also a valuable resource for anyone who wants to build their own real estate price prediction website.




## Features

- The project is divided into three main parts: data preparation, model building, and deployment.
- The data preparation part includes cleaning the data, and engineering features.
- The model building part includes selecting a model, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating the model.
- The deployment part includes creating a Flask server and writing the necessary code to serve the model.
- The project uses a variety of Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm.
